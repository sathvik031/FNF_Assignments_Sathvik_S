
//Interface is a set of members that can be implemented by a class. It contains only abstract methods. Interfaces cannot have fields, properties, or constructors. They can have methods, events, and indexers. A class can implement multiple interfaces, allowing for a form of multiple inheritance. Interfaces are used to define a contract that classes must adhere to, promoting loose coupling and flexibility in design.
//interface members cannot have access modifiers. All members of an interface are implicitly public and abstract.
//Purpose of the interface is to define a contract that compells a class that implements it to provide public implementations for the members defined in the interface.
//If an class implements an interface, it means that the class is providing a concrete implementation for all the members defined in the interface. This allows for polymorphism, where a reference of the interface type can be used to refer to an object of the class that implements the interface.
